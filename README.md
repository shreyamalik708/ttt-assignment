## Explaination

# Components: 

Within './src/components', three components have been established to enhance organization and readability, facilitating the potential for component reuse:

i) Navbar
ii) Profile
iii) Feed

The Profile component incorporates Material UI for various icons such as Star, Thumb (for Like), Favourite, and Total Views.

Following that, the primary component, Feed, employs the useState hook for efficient state management and data storage within variables.

The webpage is designed to be responsive, offering compatibility across multiple devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Throughout the project, React Material UI is consistently used for icon implementation.

Moreover, the useEffect hook is employed to ensure the rendering of functions in the browser, encompassing features like post liking and unliking.
